### WHAT IS IT?
#
# This file:
#    1. Contains definition of simple neural network with two hidden layers.
#    2. Is NOT meant to be any sensible neural network for any purpose.
#    3. Presents file's neural network text format.
#
### FORMAT
#
# Format of this file is simple. It consists of 4 sections:
#    1. Declaration of number of neurons in all of the layers.
#       If you want to specify layer's bias append 'b' character to number.
#    2. Declaration of activation functions for all layers.
#       List of all available activation functions:
#         - sigmoid,
#         - linear,
#         - bipolar,
#         - sin,
#         - tanh,
#         - elliott,
#         - elliott_sym,
#         - gaussian,
#         - bipolar_sigmoid,
#         - off (no activation function - ie. for input layer).
#    3. Declaration of biases for all of the 'b'-marked layers from #1.
#    4. Weights of connection between neighboring layers for the subsequent
#       neurons.
#
### NOTE
#
#    1. Double and float numbers use comma or dot
#       character depending on your locale.
#    2. All whitespaces are ignored.
#    3. Comments begin with '#' character.
