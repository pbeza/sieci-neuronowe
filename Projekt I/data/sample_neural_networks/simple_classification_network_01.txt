#  WHAT IS IT?
#
# This file:
#    1. contains definition of simple neural network with one hidden layer,
#    2. is NOT meant to be any sensible neural network for any purpose,
#    3. presents file's neural network text format.
#
# FORMAT
#
# Format of this file is simple. It consists of 3 sections:
#    1. declaration of number of neurons in all layers,
#    2. declaration of biases in all layers,
#    3. weights of connection between neighboring layers for the subsequent
#       neurons.
#
# NOTE
#
#    1. Double and float numbers use comma or dot
#       character depending on your locale.
#    2. All whitespaces are ignored.
#    3. Comments begin with '#' character.
